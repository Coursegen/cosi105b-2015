<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read \[POODR\] Chapters 8 and 9. Apply what you are learing to the team's nanoTwitter project.
* Read [Minimalicious testing in Ruby 1.9 with MiniTest](http://blog.arvidandersson.se/2012/03/28/minimalicous-testing-in-ruby-1-9)
* Do the assignment in <%= link_to_topic :hw_tdd %>. Do it in your <%= :portfolio %> under subdirectory `tdd_example`. <%= deliverable "Code in your portolio." %>
* Complete nT functionality TESTSUITE, SEEDDATA, CODESHIP and HEROKU. Work should be done in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `/nanotwitter`. When complete, submit it to github. <%= team_deliverable "Completed nanoTwitter Version 0.2 github URL" %>. You should use the same github repo but tag the previous version as 0.1 and the current version of 0.2. (See [Git Tagging](http://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging))

<%= callout("REMINDER", " Your portfolios will be reviewed and graded TODAY for progress.") %>

#### Discussion
* Homework
  * Did you really do TDD? What is the key to it?
  * How did it feel to program in this way? Was it easier, harder, different?
  * Conventions: file names, separating the tests from the code (why?)
* Experiment with Q/A site
* Loader.io!
