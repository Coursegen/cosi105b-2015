<%= homework_hdr %>
* Study [POODR] Chapter 5. <%= ir "Points to understand:" %>
  * Duck typing. How to use it. How it works. Notice how you need to think pretty carefully about the role of each class in your design to make sure you place a method. Can you explain what Duck typing is?
  * There are almost always multiple classes where a certain bit of functionality could be placed. To be a good designer you have to first become aware of the possibilities and then reason about why it belongs in a certain place. What are some considerations for making that decision?
* Think about this question: What is Duck typing, and exactly how is it different from Java. Try to answer the question: what specific feature in Java do you not need anymore if you have Duck Typing. <%= deliverable "Submit a response as a pdf. Explain your reasoning. It's a tricky question." %>
* Complete nT functionality up to [SINATRAAPP]. Work should be done in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>. <%= team_deliverable "Completed nanoTwitter Version 0.1 github URL" %>
