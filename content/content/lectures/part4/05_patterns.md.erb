* Complete nT 0.3 functionality 
	* See <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>: LOADTEST, INSTRUMENT, RUNLOADEXPERIMENT and MANUALTEST
	* Of course this assumes that you have fully completed last week's assignment for nT 0.2
		* You need to have your loader.io account set up with log ins for all three team members
