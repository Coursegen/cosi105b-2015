title: Design Patterns
desc: Review and go deeper on Design Patterns
homework: nT 0.3, listen to podcast and read article, write reflection the night before!
---
<%= homework_hdr %>
* Actively Read/Listen. <%= ir "Submit answers to the questions by midnight before class" %>
  * [The Art of Enbugging](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/related-work/pragmatic-programmer/jan_03_enbug.pdf)
  * [Book Club: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture with Martin Fowler](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/097-rr-book-club-patterns-of-enterprise-architecture-with-martin-fowler)
  * Answer these 3 questions:
    * In what way are the "Tell don't ask" and the "Law of Demeter" principles related, that is, serving the same more basic purpose?
    * Explain the Active record pattern and how it is related or different from the Data mapper pattern.
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading/listening did you not undertand; and if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you.
  * <%= deliverable "BY MIDNIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE: the answers to these questions, as a pdf, 1 page max" %>

* Complete nT 0.3 functionality 
	* See <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>: LOADTEST, INSTRUMENT, RUNLOADEXPERIMENT and MANUALTEST
	* Of course this assumes that you have fully completed last week's assignment for nT 0.2
		* You need to have your loader.io account set up with log ins for all three team members
		* You need to have at least 5 tests in your test suite
		* You need to have Codeship.com configured, and have codeship in turn deploy to heroku
	* Work should be done in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `/nanotwitter`. When complete, submit it to github. You should use the same github repo but tag the previous version as 0.2 and the current version of 0.2. (See [Git Tagging](http://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging))
  * Team Interim Report: Write a report describing process so far, and results of initial tests (from your lab notebook).
  * <%= team_deliverable "Team interim report, 1-2 pages, pdf, including completed nanoTwitter Version 0.3 github URL" %>

#### Demos
* Each team will be asked to demo their version of nT to the class by having everyone sign up for an account!

#### Design Patterns
* Patterns in software (inspired by:[A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195019199))
* Patterns and Anti-patterns
* Anti-patterns vs. Code smells
* Why do these buzz words matter anyway?

#### "Meta patterns" or "just good design"
* Knowledge should be in only one place (DRY)
* Separate out things that change from those that stay the same
* Tell don't ask
* Prefer composition over inheritance
* Delay, delay, delay \[YAGNI\]

#### Examples we've already seen
* MVC, Model View Controller
* Template class and template method pattern
* Factory class and factory method pattern
* REST Pattern
* ActiveRecord Pattern
* Service Oriented Architecture

#### What are the Major ones?
* There are many catalogs
* Some patterns are 'language dependent'
  * e.g. dynamic vs. static typing, method overloading, multiple inheritance
* Don't try to memorize them
* Don't feel like you are more 'virtuous' if you do use them
* But... DO learn about them and try to use them

#### Some of my favorites
* Template method pattern: [Ruby Design Patterns: The Template Method
](http://sethpollack.net/blog/2015/01/11/ruby-design-patterns-the-template-method/)
* Factory pattern: [Gang of Four Design Patterns: Factory](https://github.com/tutsplus/gof-design-patterns-ruby/tree/master/examples/factory/test)
* Strategy pattern: [Gang of Four Design Patterns: Strategy](https://github.com/tutsplus/gof-design-patterns-ruby/tree/master/examples/strategy/lib/newsletter)
* Builder pattern. My own code for "Coursegen": [bootstrap_markup](https://github.com/pitosalas/coursegen/blob/master/lib/coursegen/course/helpers/bootstrap_markup.rb)
* Domain Specific Language Pattern: [Writing a DSL in Ruby](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-domain-specific-language-in-ruby)
* Delegator + Decorator Pattern: [Using Simple Delegator for your Decorators](http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/using-simpledelegator-for-your-decorators)

#### References
* [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series-ebook/dp/B0010SEN1S/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)
* Interesting repo with examples of patterns: [Ruby Patterns](https://github.com/TheBlasfem/ruby-patterns)
* The original GoF Book, now a little dated IMO: [Desing Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
