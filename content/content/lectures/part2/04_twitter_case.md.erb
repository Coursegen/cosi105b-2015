* If you don't use Twitter or don't 'believe in it', still sign up for an account just to play. <%= ir "Make sure you understand each of the core concepts of Twitter:" %>
  * a username (aka Twitter handle) your name on twitter
  * to "mention":when you write @pitosalas in a tweet; 
  * to followi: when you ask to see tweets from someone else; 
  * [n,v] "tweet" or "post" or "update": the 140 character message you can send with twitter.
  * a twitter stream or feed: all the tweets that a certain user has posted
  * a #hashtag: a way to tag any tweet, which can be searched later
  * a timeline: a real time stream of twwets. Your home stream or timeline is where you see all the tweets shared by the people you follow
* View [Twitter: From Ruby on Rails to the JVM](http://youtu.be/ohHdZXnsNi8) AND [Real Time Delivery Architecture at Twitter](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Real-Time-Delivery-Twitter). <%= ir "Make sure you understand (and research if needed)" %>
  * Theres a polar difference between the way a new tweet appears on each user's timeline and the way a new tweet appears in a search result. If you can explain that you have understood the video. I will be asking for comments in class.
  * Based on those two videos, draw a architectural diagram with as much detail as you understand. No more than 20 diagram boxes though. Add labels and comments as needed. You can draw neatly on paper, or use some tool to make a diagram, whatever you prefer. 
  * <%= deliverable "The diagram as a .pdf. For paper, take a cell phone picture that is clear enough to read." %>

#### Discussion about homework
