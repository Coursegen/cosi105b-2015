<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read and do all the steps in this tutorial: [Making a simple, database driven website with Sinatra and Heroku](http://samuelstern.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/making-a-simple-database-driven-website-with-sinatra-and-heroku/). Here you will see essentially all the basic step you would need to create a simple version of nanoTwitter. Expect not to understand everything but I want you to start getting a feel of the lay of the land. 

    I have done the complete example and made a video of it. Feel free to follow it but you must also type it in on your computer and get it to work. As for help if you require it!
