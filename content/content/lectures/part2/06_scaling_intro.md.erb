<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read [SODRR] Chapter 3.
  * This chapter introduces a running example of this book. It is a social feed reader. It's analogous but different from our nanoTwitter. It is actually a little more complicated than what will be our running project.
  * In this chapter you learn what all the database tables (and therefore what the Models are.) Based on what we've covered so far you should be able to follow it.
  * This chapter mentions Rails. Rails is a bigger sort-of-superset of Sinatra. They are both Ruby libraries. In this class we will be using Sinatra (not Rails)
  * Don't get confused: We **are** using ActiveRecord which is a separable Rails library which is also used in Sinatra. It is the "Object Relational Mapper."
  * It is most important that you take the time to understand the overall set of tables, why they exist and how they relate to each other.
* Start your design of nanoTwitter. Begin with the data model. Create a neat diagram of all the tables and the relationships between them. Use lines to connect the tables to each other for each has_many, belongs_to etc. relationship. <%= deliverable "the diagram as a pdf" %>
