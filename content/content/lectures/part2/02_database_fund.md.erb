<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read [SODRR] Chapter 1. 
  * This chapter builds on the basics we covered at the last lecture. Also it covers much of the same ground as the last tutorial, but goes a little further. Make sure you get help from the TAs if you are stuck! 
  * A few differences you will see ar
    * This example uses "sqlite3" instead of "postgres" as the database server. 
    * Also you will see an early introduction to rspec, which is a testing library for ruby. We will learn a lot more about that later.
    * And you will also get a review of using forms and html. 
    * If you are unsure, refer back to <%= link_to_lecture :serv_fund %>. There are additional links there that will help you understand.
  * *You are required to do all the examples, by typing them in yourself and getting them to work. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.*
