* Watch and Read
  * Watch: [Basics of Database Sharding](https://youtu.be/W6pFKihvqH4). Quick explanation: Sharding is way to break a database that is getting too big into two (or n). Each is called a "shard", and has the same schema. A certain record is sent to one or the other shard based on some value, e.g. their last name or employee id.
  * Read: [5 Early Lessons from Rapid High Availability Scaling](http://mikepackdev.com/blog_posts/40-5-early-lessons-from-rapid-high-availability-scaling-with-rails). Don't be concerned that it mentions "Rails", the lessons are equally applicable (almost) to Sinatra
  * Think about and answer these questions:
  	* What is meant by denormalization and what does it has to do with scalability?
  	* Can you clarify why the article says that you are screwed if you don't create an index early?
    * What's the SSD that is mentioned in the context of the sharing article and why does it matter?
    * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading/listening did you not undertand; and if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you.

* Teams, continue to work on nanoTwitter. This is your primary deliverable at this point.

#### Discussion
* Points Raised in the reading
  * Multiple questions about denormalization
  * Sharding
    * Why would anyone ever use anything other than Hash lookup
    * How to apply it to nanoTwitter
    * Is it always a good idea?
    * How does consistent hashing even work?
  * Terms
    * Chokepoint
    * Indexing: Note the uniqueness argument too
    * Universal User: What?

#### What is scaling?
* Measuring performance: 
  * How many Xs per second?
  * and/orhow long does it take to Y?
* Analysis
  * Instrumentation (basically logging)
  * Deep thought
  * Identify the bottle neck
* Action
  * Remove the bottle neck
