<%= homework_hdr %>
* Complete all lessons of Ruby the Hard Way. <%= deliverable "Zip up all the code and hand it in." %>
* Read [R.Charette, “Why Software Fails - IEEE Spectrum.”](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails.)
* Watch [Healthcare.gov failure: Analysis and discussion](http://youtu.be/Rl5WFz6Gi28) ([alternative](http://www.frequency.com/video/cs169-v13-w8l2s7/132108449))

#### Discussions
* Based on the readings and video lets discuss common and not so common for software failure.

#### What is Engineering?
* Is software engineering **ENGINEERING**?
* What are some of the key characteristics that qualifies an activity as "engineering?"
* Is it different from "just programming?"

#### Things to look for
* MUST HAVE: Software Repositories, version management, etc.
* Software is "designed" not just "coded" (but beware of BDOF)
* Focus on testing of all kinds at all levels
* Focus on maintainability
