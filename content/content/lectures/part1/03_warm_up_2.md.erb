#### Homework due for today

* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 36. You will learn more about files (which you can use for your programming assignment too. Also we get into functions and control flow. The section ends with thoughts about design. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Read "Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby" [POODR] Chapter 1 and 2. Make sure you really understand the ruby syntax for defining classes and also try to answer for yourself what the "Single Responsibility Principle" is about, and why it is important. What are some ways in which you could check whether your class has a single responsibility? What do you think Sandi Metz means by "exemplary" code? What is her view of design? See if you can understand why she calls the "message" the foundation of Object Orientation. Do you know what she means by a "message"? Remember to do all the examples, by typing them in yourself and getting them to work. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> and remember to apply what you've learned so far from the reading so far. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> for it to be graded.
