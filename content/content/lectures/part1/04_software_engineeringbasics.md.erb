<%= homework_hdr %>
* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should be at least up to Lesson 45. You will learn about the wonders of arrays and hashes. Also one of the more advanced ruby features, modules. And now you start getting into somewhat more abstract stuff, object oriented analysis and design.. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Read [R.Charette, “Why Software Fails - IEEE Spectrum.”](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails.)
* Watch [Healthcare.gov failure: Analysis and discussion](http://youtu.be/Rl5WFz6Gi28) ([also available here...](http://www.frequency.com/video/cs169-v13-w8l2s7/132108449))

#### Discussions
* Based on the readings and video lets discuss common and not so common for software failure.

#### What is Engineering?
* Is software engineering **ENGINEERING**?
* What are some of the key characteristics that qualifies an activity as "engineering?"
* Is it different from "just programming?"

#### Things to look for
* MUST HAVE: Software Repositories, version management, etc.
* Software is "designed" not just "coded" (but beware of BDOF)
* Focus on testing of all kinds at all levels
* Focus on maintainability

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
