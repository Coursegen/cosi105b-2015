<%= bold_red("Note for first day of class:") %> Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day.

**So in other words, the homework listed here is actually "pre-work" for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.**

* Locate and begin going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). You will be responsible for all 52 lessons plus closing chapters in 1 week.

#### Introductions

* Introduce Pito, where I came from, and why I am excitied about this course. Read: <%= link_to_topic :pitofaq %>

#### What is this course about: Software Engineering and Design

#### Homeworks and Grading
* The prime source for this course is this web site.
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
* There you will find the list of homeworks due for the class
* Latte is used just as a way to submit homeworks

#### How to do homework
* Yes there is a fair bit of homework. All homework is numbered by: Lecture Number.Deliverable number. So for example, the first deliverable listed on for this lecture is 1.1.
* Often there is a concrete deliverable, a blog post, a zip file with code, etc. Those have to be submitted to latte.
* If there is no concrete deliverable, you can assume that it will be discussed in class and you will be called on.
