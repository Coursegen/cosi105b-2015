* **Class Participation:** includes being in class on time when the class starts, handing in homeworks that are assigned, being prepared by having done the reading, coding, viewing assigned so that when you are called on in class you can have something to say.

* **Team Participation:** Working in teams is hard and requires a businesslike, constructive, flexible, respectful behavior among the team members. Remember that I am not asking you to become best friends, just to figure out how to get the most out of each other. I won't be able to tell if you are just along for the ride, or actually doing a lot of work.
