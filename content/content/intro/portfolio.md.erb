title: Portfolio
---
#### What it is
Throughout this course there will be many programming homeworks. You will be organizing them into a coursework portfolio on the Brandeis server so that you are not constantly handing in bits and pieces.

<%= callout("IMPORTANT", " You are required to organize your portfolio in a very specific way so that we can automatically review your work.") %>

#### Grading
* Every weekyour TA will evaluate your portfolio directory and give it a score which will be based on:
  * How current you are with the assignments
  * How well you have applied the learnings so far regarding coding style, design, object orientation, good naming and so on.
  
#### Organizing your portfolio

You will be given a directory on the brandeis server called portfolio/yourname/.... This will be your work area for all programming assignments. Within that create the following directory structure:

* `portfolio/yourname/hardway` - Contains all the code written as you read along "Ruby The Hard Way", organized lesson by lesson, lesson1, lesson2, etc. In each lesson* subdirectory will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson (e.g. ex5.rb) plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson in one or two sentences.
* `portfolio/yourname/poodr` - Contains programs written as you read along in "Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby", organized by chapter, ch1, ch2 etc. Wach ch* subdirectory will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson.
* `portfolio/yourname/sodrr` - Containing programs written as you read along in "Service Oriented Design in Ruby on Rails", organized by chapter, ch1, ch2, etc. In each ch* subdirectory you will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson.
* `portfolio/yourname/...` - Other discrete programming assignments such as <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>, <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> and so on, each get a subdirectory under `portfolio/yourname`. In each subdirectory will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson.

Note: you only need subdirectories for those lessons, chapters or progamming assignments that you actually got to.

#### Example

* A typical set up will look like this:
