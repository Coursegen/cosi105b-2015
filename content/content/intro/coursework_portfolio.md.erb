title: Course work portfolio
---
Throughout this course there will be many programming homeworks. You will be organizing them into a coursework portfolio so that you are not constantly handing in bits and pieces.

<%= callout("IMPORTANT", " You are required to organize your portfolio in a very specific way so that we can automatically review your work.") %>

#### Organizing your portfolio

* Please create a single directory somewhere called "cosi105b" which will contain all your coding work, as a series of subdirectories:

* `hardway` - Contains all the code written as you read along "Ruby The Hard Way", organized lesson by lesson, lesson1, lesson2, etc.
* `cosi105b/poodr` - Contains programs written as you read along in "Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby", organized by chapter, ch1, ch2 etc.
* `cosi105b/sodrr` - Containing programs written as you read along in "Service Oriented Design in Ruby on Rails", organized by chapter, ch1, ch2, etc
* `cosi105b/pa` - Containing each of the "programming assignments" you write, organized by pa_id, movies, mazes, etc.

Note: you only need subdirectories for those lessons, chapters or progamming assignments that you actually got to.

#### Example

* A typical set up will look like this:

~~~~
cburkh/
  cosi105b/
    hardway/
      lesson1/

      lesson2/
        ...
    poodr/
      ch2/
        ...rb
        ...rb
      ch3/
        ...rb
    sodrr/
      ch1/
        ...rb
      ch2/
        ...rb
    pa/
      movies/
        ...rb
~~~~

#### Git/Github
* Later in the course we will learn git and github
* Your own course portfolio will be set up at that point as a github directory
