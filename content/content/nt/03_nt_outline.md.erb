#### Approximate Recipe
1. Design html, forms, and user interface
1. Design integrated relational database schema (i.e. one for the whole app)
1. Implement Sinatra front end application for ui. Use ActiveRecord and postgress
1. Implement a large body of seed data with automation
1. Write complete set of tests with automation
1. Revise user interface to make it pretty, using Bootstrap
1. Deploy to Heroku. Make sure tests still run.
1. Go back to the beginning Design external API urls
1. Implement them as further Sinatra routes
1. Write a complete set of tests for them
1. Investigate and choose a way to load test your app (see for example BlazMeter)
1. Investigate and choose a way to instrument your test app (see for example NewRelic)
1. To a series of load tests and write a report of your findings
1. Update your schema to put indeces and other enhancements and see the effect on scaling
1. Try different databases (SqlLite, Mysql, Postgres, Mongo) and see the effect on scaling
1. Do scaling experiments and see the differences
1. Investigate and figure out how to setup a Redis Caching service
1. Consider where to add caching and do some more experiments to see how scaling changes
